A soldier of the Rohirrim hailed the heroes and they rode on, silent as shadows.\r\nIt was three days before they found his trail, some miles past the great fortress at Helm’s Deep where the king of old had waged bitter war against the Dunlendings. Three days of tireless vigil, of stomachs empty as stones, of aching thighs, of horses with eyes black as marbles and wild as a nightmare.\r\nAs they rode it felt as if seasons passed; the warm weather which they had enjoyed so well now faded with every hoofbeat.
