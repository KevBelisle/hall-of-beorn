        <p>I'm terribly sorry, but the page you requested was eaten by a dragon.<br/>
        If you continue to have problems with pesky dragons, please do <a href="mailto:hallofbeorn@gmail.com">contact us</a>.<br/>
        You probably want to <a href="/LotR">go back to the hall</a> where it is warm and safe, and leave me to finish my bath...<br/>
