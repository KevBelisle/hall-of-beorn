Many hours were also spent researching third party printers to recommend and making many experimental print runs until we were happy with the detail and color.\r\nIn addition to making the cards look as close to official as possible, we also followed the Deluxe + 6 Adventure Pack model from FFG that long-term players would be familiar with. Each cycle of course has a theme, so for the theme of this cycle, we took a look at past cycles from FFG, and saw that there had been cycles that featured mono-sphere cards (<i>Against the Shadow</i>), multi-sphere cards (<i>Dream-chaser</i>), and multi-trait cards (<i>Haradrim</i>). So we decided to round this out with a cycle that focused on mono-trait cards.\r\nThe mono-trait focus led us to a couple major design decisions. First, we would set our story for the cycle in a time period slightly earlier than FFG’s when the various races and factions were more insular and had not yet come together against the growing shadow.\r\n\r\nPage 11/14",

We decided early on that the player cards would be released in a more synergistic way than FFG’s traditional model. Cards that work well together would all appear in the same set rather than spread throughout the cycle. At ALeP, we don’t receive any money for the content we produce, so we felt this strategy would be more friendly to players who are only interested in one or two different archetypes. It also meant that players would not have to wait for the cycle to be complete in order to realize the full potential of the new archetypes we were introducing.\r\nSpeaking of player card archetypes, we made a conscious decision to focus in this cycle on certain traits that we felt did not quite meet their full potential in the official card pool, like <b><i>Rohan</i></b> and <b><i>Beorning</i></b>. We introduced many cards for these archetypes, some of them quite powerful, so that they could adequately compete with (but not outshine) many of the other archetypes established by FFG. Hundreds of playtesting hours were spent trying to get this balance right, and\r\n\r\nPage 12/14",

Instead, we focused on giving them a more fully realized alternate mode of play, which in the case of the <b><i>Noldor</i></b> meant improving the “top-of-the-discard” archetype. We felt this was in keeping with FFG’s method of developing mining-style cards for the dwarves rather than continuing to strengthen their swarm mechanic.\r\nFFG is known for building a brand new trait archetype over the course of a cycle, such as <b><i>Ent</i></b>, <b><i>Harad</i></b>, <b><i>Dale</i></b> etc. We wanted to keep this tradition alive by expanding the <b><i>Bree</i></b> trait. We didn’t have much to go on from FFG’s side apart from the Barliman Butterbur ally, but we nevertheless took that ally’s seed of “undefended attacks” and tried to make it grow. We felt that it made sense for the <b><i>Bree</i></b> archetype to be particularly resilient to these types of attacks, as they have no standing army and would be largely defenseless if invaded. We hope you found this style of play fresh, exciting, and a little risky!\r\n\r\nPage 13/14",

We are equally proud of the accompanying quests that all have their unique feel and challenge thanks to the roster of different encounter designers. Each quest designer was given complete creative control over their quest, and we hope that you feel that they all managed to produce quests that felt very different, while still adhering to the overarching story for the cycle.\r\nWhen it comes to the playtesting and game balance of both the player cards and the quests, it cannot be understated how important our software team has been. Thanks to a highly advanced data pipeline, we now have a system where all the card data lives in a spreadsheet, and when a change is made to a card attribute, or a new card is designed, a notification is sent to that card’s channel in the ALeP Discord, highlighting what text had changed, and a new card is generated and available for playtest in DragnCards within minutes. If a card was added or removed from a quest, that encounter deck gets updated as well. This has helped us achieve a state of iterative design that we believe rivals, if not exceeds, most industry tabletop design processes.\r\nWe hope you have been happy with the quality of content from ALeP so far. And we hope you stay with us for the long-extended future!\r\n\r\nPage 14/14",
