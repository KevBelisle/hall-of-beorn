He swore to tell us of the sign of the white horse on a red field. It has been seen among the traitorous Rohirrim who attacked us at the beacon and amid the city streets.”\r\nEaldwulf bowed slightly. He was an old man, though with a royal bearing.

He was well-loved by the men here. They still celebrate his valour in the Old War against Dunland. When he died…” Ealdwulf paused. “When he and his brother perished, the line of succession was broken. And so the crown of Rohan passed to the grandfathers of Thengel-king.”\r\n“Could it be Gálmód and his men seek to restore the line of Haleth?” said a hero.</i>\r\n\r\nPage 3/8",

They visited the hamlets of decent folk – horse-breeders and plowmen, laborers who smelt of salt and straw and took their meals with a smile. Many such villages did the heroes visit, and each offered the same unanswerable question. “How many would see their king deposed? How many would betray their people in the name of some faithless usurper?” As they journeyed, this uncertainty grew. Each village seemed a little grayer, a little less kindly. They slept little, and when they did it was roughly, in empty fields or in the stables amid the nickering of half-broken geldings and dark-eyed mares.\r\nIt was on one such night, looking outward on the endless plains, that they spotted a familiar glow in the distance.
