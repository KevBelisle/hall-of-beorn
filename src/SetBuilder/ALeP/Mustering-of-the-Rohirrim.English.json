It was midnight in Aldburg and the old lord rose from his bed; he had not slept. He stood before a rack of armor: an empty shell, long shed. He was a warlord born to a time of war. A sword born bloody, and sheathed before its time. No longer. For all the kingsblood which ran through his grandfather’s veins, war was his only inheritance. His blade was polished.\r\nIn the dim of his bedchamber, while a solitary candle dripped and quavered, Ealdwulf accepted the truth. He girded himself in the broken armor of his godsire, Prince Haleth, the Red Stallion. He lashed a buckler to his tired, creaking arm.</i>\r\n\r\nPage 2/6",
